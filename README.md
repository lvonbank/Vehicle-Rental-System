# Vehicle-Rental-System

Design a database for a car rental company. The company has multiple locations, and each location offers different car types (such as compact cars, midsize cars, SUVs, etc.) at different rental charge per day. The database should be able to keep track of customers, vehicle rented, and the rental payments. It should also keep track of vehicles, their make, and mileage.  Make assumptions about business rules as necessary. Provide your assumptions.
1. Create an ERD (Crowâ€™s Foot notation) for the database.
2. Create 3NF tables and relationships in SQL Server.
3. Perform reverse engineering if necessary.
4. Enter sufficient test data in your tables using DDL statements. Using an INNER JOIN statement, show the rental revenue collected by each location or branch.
6. Create the following queries: a Subquery, a CTE, and a PIVOT using the data and tables in your tables.
7. Create a clustered index of your database on SQL Server.
8. Replicate your database in MySQL.
9. Create a web form using PHP to query the MySQL database show the rental revenue collected by each location or branch.
